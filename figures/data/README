# Artifacts Supporting SV Types

## Purpose
Analyze which SV types are supported by model-identified artifact reads in original data (Set A).

## Analysis
- Model predictions: CNN/Hyena on mk1c/P2 datasets  
- Match artifact reads to SVs in VCF files
- Count SV type distribution and multi-support patterns

## Files
- `analyze_artifacts_sv_support.py`: Analysis script
- `artifacts_sv_analysis_results.txt`: Results
- 4 subdirectories: Model predictions + VCF files

Expected: Artifacts mainly support inversions (consistent with MDA literature).
